Router
1. New config system for multiple LLMs and APIs, with roles
2. Create router check system, where a message chain can be input into the router checker to see if it should activate
3. These checks expose hooks, available prior to llm calls
4. If a rule is true, we switch to that LLM

MVP
1. Create a remote llm and local llm config
2. If message length goes beyond a configurable threshold, switch to remote

Open Qs
* Can we implement a hand-back feature, where the llm could optionally decide if it could crunch the context down?
